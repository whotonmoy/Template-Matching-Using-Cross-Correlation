# Template-Matching-Using-Cross-Correlation
Advanced Template Matching: Implementing Cross-Correlation for Image Analysis

It is a program for template matching using cross-correlation. The program has been tested on “text_image.raw” using “letter_R.raw” as the template. The output is a gray scale image displaying the magnitudes of the cross-correlation results.

This was an assignment that I did in my second to last semester(Fall 2023) for Image Processing Course (CS 425).
